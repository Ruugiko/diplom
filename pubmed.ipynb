       "'The present study was designed to investigate potential biomarkers of depression and targets of antidepressants from the perspective of hippocampal endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) based on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomics. Firstly, a six-week depression model was established and treated with fluoxetine (FLX). We found antidepressant-FLX could ameliorate depression-like behaviors and cognition in depressed rats caused by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). FLX significantly increased neuronal numbers in dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3 regions of hippocampus. CSF proteome data revealed thirty-seven differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) co-regulated by CUMS and FLX, including GRP94 and EIF2α. Results of Gene Oncology (GO) annotation and KEGG pathway enrichment for DEPs mainly included PERK-mediated unfolded protein response, endoplasmic reticulum, and translational initiation. The expression levels of GRP94, p-PERK, p-EIF2α, CHOP and Caspase-12 were increased in hippocampus of CUMS rats, and FLX worked the opposite way. FLX had strong affinity and binding activity with GRP94 protein, and four key proteins on the PERK pathway (PERK, EIF2α, p-EIF2α, CHOP). We proposed that FLX may exert antidepressant effects and neuroprotective action by alleviating excessive activation of the hippocampal PERK pathway and reducing neuronal deficits in depressed rats. PERK, EIF2α, p-EIF2α, and CHOP may be potential targets for antidepressant-FLX. GRP94 in CSF may be a potential biomarker of depression and the therapeutic effects of antidepressants.'"
